The notice is a small reminder that the post is unpublished and it can be dismissed with a single click. Of course, to remove the warnings globally, just deactivate the plugin.

= 0.3.2 =

Tried to fix versioning.

= 0.3.1 =

1. Fixed the paths for enqueueing the stylesheet and the javascript. Previously, it had been assuming that the 'Unpublished Warnings' directory would have a particular name, but now it will figure the directory name out for itself, so different directory names should work seamlessly.
1. The jQuery effect for dismissing the warning was previously a .hide(), but I prefer the .slideUp() effect, so now the plugin uses the latter.

= 0.3 =
The basic functionality seems to work.

== Upgrade Notice ==
